This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
have read over the years.<br>

Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Easter dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled
meats and pitta breads.<br>

<mark><h1>Ingredients</h1></mark>
<ul>
    <li>
        cosa serve
        <ol type="a">
            <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
            <li>175g of tahini
            <li>6 sundried tomatoes
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Half a red pepper
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper
    <li>1 clove of garlic
    <li>A dash of olive oil
</ul>
<!--ciao-->
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
</ol>
For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you<br>

<h3>Storage</h3>

Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made
it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
